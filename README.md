Jumpstart
=========

Basically my own flavor of a starting app, utilizing authlogic for authentication, cancan for authorization rspec / cucumber for testing.

It also includes the usual rspec matchers in the plugins.

Example:

    rails galatea -m http://github.com/cyx/rails-templates/raw/master/jumpstart.rb
    # Lots of output here

    =========================
    Specify the Project Name:
    galatea # hit enter
  
    ...
    ...

    applied  http://github.com/cyx/rails-templates/raw/master/jumpstart.rb
    

Probably the most compelling reason to use this is for the pre-built authlogic controllers and models, but of course it's built for my taste.
